# CS372FinalProject
Welcome To Our Pepe Clicker.

Game was developed in Xamarin, we could not fit the whole solution to the game as the file was too big


A quick background of our game.

This app for android phones is a simplified cookieclicker, made with our favorite meme character, Pepe (peh-peh). 

This frog became an internet sensational meme in the early 2005's and it gained so much traction that it was eventually

used as a hate symbol. This however is not the case for our project

and we have used this pepe in a whole hearted sense in order to preserve his

innocence. 

How To Play:

You click the Pepe!
With the Pepe currency you can upgrade your Pepe's colours and see your Pepe evolve!

(For presentation purposes, our values have been left low in order to show functionality of our shop, currency, and transitions
to and from the game to the shop.)

For our testing purposes we developed the app on Xamarin c#, on a Pixel 2, android pie 9.0 API 28.
